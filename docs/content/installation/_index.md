Codefresh CLI is developed and built with node.js. <br />

In case you have node.js installed on your machine you can use [NPM](/cli/installation/npm), [YARN](/cli/installation/yarn) or [HOMEBREW](cli/installation/homebrew/) to install it.<br>

If you don't have node.js installed you can install the CLI by [Downloading](/cli/installation/download) it directly.<br />

It is also possible to run the CLI using a [Docker image](/cli/installation/docker).
